# FRisney - Advent of Code 2022

This is my attempt on the challenges on the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

Started at 1/1/2023 and expect to end at 25/1/2023.

The challenges may be solved using `dart` and TDD.

To get the answer for the day, in the root run:
```bash
./aoc.sh run_day <day_number>
```

To get the test for the algorithm of the day, in the root run:
```bash
./aoc.sh test_day <day_number>
```
